# `geohash_tools`

This package provides tools for working with [Gustavo](https://github.com/niemeyer) [Niemeyer](https://twitter.com/gniemeyer)'s [geohash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash) system of nestable, compact global coordinates based on [Z-order curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve).

The C++ source code is largely copied from [Hiroaki Kawai](https://github.com/hkwi)'s excellent implementation of geohash encoding/decoding built with a [Python API](https://github.com/hkwi/python-geohash).

PS you should also check out these online tools for working with geohashes:
